This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in R when subsetting data frames using character vectors. The `bug.R` file contains code that attempts to select columns specified in a character vector. If one or more of these columns do not exist in the data frame, it throws an error.  The `bugSolution.R` file demonstrates a robust solution that gracefully handles missing columns.
